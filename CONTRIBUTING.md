Contributing to OpenSage
======================

This document describes contribution guidelines that are specific to OpenSage. It closely matches the guidelines defined by the [C# standard library](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) itself

Developer Guide
--------------------
In case you want some more knowledge on how to get started with development of OpenSage please take a look at our [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md). 

Coding Style Changes
--------------------

OpenSage tries to strictly match the coding style described in [Coding Style](docs/coding-style.md). We plan to do that with tooling, in a holistic way. In the meantime, please:

* **DO NOT** send PRs for style changes.

Pull Requests
-------------

* **DO** submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.
* **DO** give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. "Improve code coverage for System.Console by 10%", not "Fix #1234")
* **DO** refer to any relevant issues, and include [keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.
* **DO** tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.
* **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds.  The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it'll be merged.
* **DO** address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary.  This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.
* **DO** assume that ["Rebase and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) will be used to merge your commit unless you request otherwise in the PR.
* **DO NOT** fix merge conflicts using a merge commit. Prefer `git rebase`.
* **DO NOT** mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.

Merging Pull Requests (for contributors with write access)
----------------------------------------------------------

* **DO** use ["Rebase and Merge"](https://github.blog/2016-09-26-rebase-and-merge-pull-requests) by default for contributions.
* **DO** use ["Squash and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) in case a PR author created many small commits, which don't make a lot of sense individually.
